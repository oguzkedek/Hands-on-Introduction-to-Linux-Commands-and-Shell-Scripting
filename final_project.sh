# Set two variables equal to the values of the first and second command line arguments, as follows:
# Set targetDirectory to the first command line argument
# Set destinationDirectory to the second command line argument

# Display the values of the two command line arguments in the terminal.

# Define a variable called currentTS as the current timestamp, expressed in seconds.

# Define a variable called backupFileName to store the name of the archived and compressed backup file that the script will create.

# We're going to:
  # 1: Go into the target directory
  # 2: Create the backup file
  # 3: Move the backup file to the destination directory

# To make things easier, we will define some useful variables...

# Define a variable called origAbsPath with the absolute path of the current directory as the variable's value.

# Define a variable called destAbsPath with value equal to the absolute path of the destination directory.

# [TASK 7]
# Change directories from the current working directory to the target directory targetDirectory.

# TASK 9 
#Â Within the $() expression inside the for loop, write a command that will return all files and directories in the current folder.
# TASK 10 
# Inside the for loop, you want to check whether the $file was modified within the last 24 hours.
# To get the last-modified date of a file in seconds, use date -r $file +%s
# TASK 11
# In the if-then statement, add the $file that was updated in the past 24-hours to the toBackup array.

  # [TASK 10]

# [TASK 12]
# After the for loop, compress and archive the files, using the $toBackup array of filenames, to a file with the name backupFileName.

tar -czvf $backupFileName $toBackup

# [TASK 13]
# Move the file backupFileName to the destination directory located at destAbsPath.
